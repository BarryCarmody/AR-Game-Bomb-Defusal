# Idea
The game follows the same loop as Minesweeper but with an additional bomb defusal mini game inside. The bomb defusal has the player entering a code to defuse the bomb and reveal adjacent cells. 

It is fully programmed in a Augmented Realiry environment, which lets the board be placed on any real world surface with a customable game board size.
